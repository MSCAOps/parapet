Parapet - Ansible automation server
-----------------------------------

Parapet allows for a host to register information about itself
and then be given an inventory of playbooks to be run.

This allows for machines that are launched dynamically (e.g. Amazon
Auto Scaling Groups) can register themselves and be given a list of
instructions to provision themselves.

The primary platform that this was developed for was for AWS services
and allows you to associate playbooks according to account number and
application. This could be used as freeform datasets for any other 
infrastructure.

Developed with web2py.
